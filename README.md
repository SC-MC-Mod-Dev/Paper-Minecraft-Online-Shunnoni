So, many people LOVE Paper Minecraft. I get it, it's fun, and free. However, there are not many places you can play it. Now, why would I care, you ask? Well, I am making an unblocked games website, and I made an entire section reserved for Minecraft, only one problem. I always get suggestions to add paper minecraft with an embed, so I published this repository. However, I was told that the Scratch version was better, so I checked it out, converted it to an HTML, and added it to this repository. Why play this, you ask? Well, simple question! Let me answer why this is better :

1. Interpolation | The original is not very smooth, so I added interpolation to make player movement smoother and much more satisfying.
2. Higher resoloution | The original is slightly blurred, as it uses the Pen extension. I fixed this by using high quality Pen.
3. No frame | Feel free to embed this on your website, as it doesn't have that ugly border that you have in fullscreen mode.
4. Updates | Every once in a while, I add an update, that makes it better than usual. I don't do this often, as I don't get a lot of people to play my games.
5. EVEN MORE STUFF FOR YOU GUYS TO ENJOY!

How to play :
Arrow keys or WASD to move. (Jumping can also be space)
O = Save
T = Chat
E = Open/Close the inventory

Thanks for playing Paper Minecraft Online! A wonderful day to you all!
